Just finished one of the most powerful projects I’ve worked on 👨‍💻
It’s an interactive educational website that delivers a smooth and secure user experience from login to final exam results! 🎯

🚪 The authentication system includes:
✅ Create a new account
✅ Secure login
✅ Forgot password feature with a verification code sent to your email
✅ Strong protection using Auth Guard so no one can access the app without logging in

📋 Once you access the exam, a welcoming modal appears, and after answering all the questions:
🔍 You get a detailed evaluation showing how many answers you got right and wrong ✅❌
And yes, the whole website is fully responsive across all screen sizes 📱💻

🛠️ Tech stack & concepts used:
	•	Clean Architecture
	•	Angular Library
	•	NgRx for state management
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	100% Responsive Design

The goal was to build a smart, organized, and smooth educational experience for every user 😎
